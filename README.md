# Gradle Build Bible

build script = build.gradle or build.gradle.kts

The highest level Gradle concept is the project. Builds scripts configures project. Project is a Java object.

## Build lifecycle

- Initialization - finds out what projects take part in our build
- Configuration - task preparation, creates model of our projects
- Execution - executes tasks using command line settings

## Tasks

Task class is a blueprint for a task. Copy task comes pre-packaged and we can use it within our project after we :
- define an instance of that task class
- configure instance -> telling Copy about details like from and into.

Ad-hoc tasks combines task class and its definition at the same point. Example:

```groovy
tasks.register('sayHello') {
    doLast {
        println 'Hello'
    }
}
```

### Task creation

#### 1) Tasks.register

Best approach as it avoid unnecesary configuration. Class-based task (of Copy class):
```groovy
tasks.register('generateDescriptions', Copy) {
// configure task
}
```

#### 2) Project.task

Has worse performance

```groovy
task('generateDescriptions', type: Copy)
```
### Locating tasks

Configuration of already defined tasks.

#### 1) tasks.named

The best performance, recommended - it returns TaskProvider class instead of Task class. Perf benefits -- see book.

```groovy
tasks.named('generateDescriptions') {
    into "$buildDir/descriptions-renamed"
}
```

#### 2) tasks.getByName

Returns Task class -- slower.

```groovy
tasks.getByName('generateDescriptions') {
into "$buildDir/descriptions-renamed"
}
```

#### 3) tasks.\<taskName>

Do not have to work with all plugins.

```groovy
tasks.clean {
    doLast {
        println 'Squeaky clean!'
    }
}
```

#### 4) \<taskName>

In Groovy DSL it is possible to use configuration by using task name.
Unfortunately it also returns Task so there is perf downside.
